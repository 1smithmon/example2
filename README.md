Capstone Project

I would like to help recommend a location in Toronto to open a restaurant. I will leverage Foursquare data on popular restaurants in Toronto in order to visualize the competition. I will also incorporate data on population per square kilometre and average income to help the restaurant owner make the decision.

The competitors' restaurants will be from Foursquare, and the population per square kilometre and average income will be from Statistics Canada Census data from 2016 (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/)
